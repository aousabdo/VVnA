# Introduction
 
The VVnA "Validation, Verification, and Accreditation" package is a package intended 
for ....

# Functions
## Projectile Motion
Projectile motion in vacuum and in air are calculated with the `Projectile` and `projFrictionLin` functions respectively. when considering air friction effects on projectiles, we only consider the viscous drag which is related to the 
velocity `v`. The Inertial drag realted to the square of the velocity is not treated in this package. 

### Projectile Motion in Vaccum

### VeriÔ¨Åcation, Validation, and Accreditation (VVnA) Project. 

This project aims to prove that experimental design (DOE) will eventually help
in the test of a system under test.

#### Functions
This package contain several functions to calculate and simulate projectile 
motion:
* Projectile: A function to calculate projectile parameters in vacuum. 
* projFrictionLin: A function to calculate projectile parameters when friction 
is presented. This function only treats the linear case of velocity dependence. 

#### Examples
Examples can be found under the example directory
